Aid & Alliance is a flagship mutual aid and resource sharing program designed to distribute nearly $500,000 in mutual aid funds to BIPOC organizers and activists across the country as March For Our Lives celebrates the three-year anniversary of the historic march to end gun violence. Through the program, MFOL chapters nationwide will be able to engage in mutual aid at the community level, and organizations in select cities will be able to apply for grant funds directly from the national organization for anti-gun violence work.

When designing the cities track, we knew that we needed to limit the number of cities that we open the program to 8. This was both an impact and a capacity decision -- with limited funds, we wanted to make sure that the size of the grants were useful to organizations and we wanted to ensure that we had the people power to manage distribution, process, and reporting. In order to select the cities in which we open the program to, I designed a custom index based on stakeholder input to rank cities across the country and give decision makers a stronger sense of ordinality of need. The final decision on which cities to include was made using the insights from this index.
